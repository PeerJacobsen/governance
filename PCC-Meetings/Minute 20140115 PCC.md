# Findings:
1. openETCS Charta  
is provided as a document on Github in [Charta](https://github.com/openETCS/Charta/tree/master/Proposal). Klaus-Rüdiger is the owner of the document. Revision and contribution of other partners is welcome.

1. Statement of Alstom regarding activities in WP3.  
Alstom stated they did not have the required capacity for the WP3 modelling activities with the background of heavy load on ERTMS experts due to activities in implementing baseline 3 in the commercial product. The release of baseline 3 by Unisig is delayed.  Alstom stated there were no other ERTMS experts from industry acting in the openETCS modelling project. With this plan the chance for achieving the project targets were not given in the frame of the ITEA project.

With this statement the representative of Alstom left the PCC meeting.

1. Dealing with the defaulting party  
Since Alstom has signed the initial version of the PCA (German prerequisite for participating in the German funded project) the issue has to be seen in the context of this version of the PCA contract.  
Alstom has withdrawn its resources from WP3 activities, including the leadership of WP3. In order to be able to continue on the project, the activities had to be resumed by other partners, e.g., DB.   
Klaus-Rüdiger proposed the to enable Project Office of openETCS to invoke the "defaulting party procedure as documented in Section 10.4 of the PCA V1.  
The proposal was accepted by vote with the following result: Yes: 11, No: 2, Abstentions: 1
Two partners were not permitted to vote since they had not signed the PCA at the time the meeting took place.  
Conclusion: Klaus-Rüdiger is now enabled to request from Alstom to return to the contribution planned in the project. Klaus-Rüdiger will distribute the letter in the PCA team for review  before sending the letter to Alstom.  
The case will be continued on the next PCC.

1. Other Decisions   
The toolchain workpackage proposed to close the activities of WP7.1. This proposal has been accepted by the PCA.

1. Status of signed PCAs  
The status of signed PCA's has been presented. Two major partners (Alstom as a group and SNCF) have not started the process of signature. Other partners signature processes are either completed or in progress (CEA, Innovalia).  
The signed PCA is  planned to be distributed soon.

1. Status of FPP Change Request  
The last FPP change request has been accepted by ITEA.
A new change request is likely to be needed (extended period of the project). The proposal will be discussed in one of the following PCC meetings.

1. OpenETCS@ITEA2 follow-up project (Commercializing Project): Ideas, Options, Schedule  
The options on a follow up project has been presented by Baseliyos. We have a new project Horizon 2020 to collect information related to this [proposal](https://github.com/openETCS/horizon2020/blob/master/openETCS_Follow_Up%40Horizon2020_MG_2.1_proposal.pdfhttps://github.com/openETCS/horizon2020/blob/master/openETCS_Follow_Up%40Horizon2020_MG_2.1_proposal.pdf).
